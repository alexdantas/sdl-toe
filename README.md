## Development

This is my first test with the SDL library.
This code was the beginning of my simple Game Envine, and
I've carried it on on [sdl-platformer](https://github.com/alexdantas/sdl-platformer),
[idj](https://github.com/alexdantas/idj) and finally
[terminus](https://github.com/alexdantas/terminus).

It's basically a lot of SDL funcionality wrapped up by several helper classes.
They're very modular, so you can take any of them and plug in your project
without worrying too much.

I tried to keep them very commented and with a simple API, so anybody could use
them without too much fuzz.

## Usage

Just do the thing you're very used to do.

    $ make
    $ make run

Make sure you have installed the following:

    SDL, SDL_Image, SDL_TTF, SDL_Mixer
